Least privilege principle:
1.Limit Node Access: We should limit exposure of the control plane and nodes to internet. If K*S running on cloud, it is likely that in some cases you won't be able to access the control plane anyway.
->For Self hosted clusters or in some managed k8s providers, provising nodes in private network is one way to achieve this. 
->And also with public access disabled and access using VPN. 
-> Security groups by allowing specific IPs to access
Minimise host OS footprint
