Least privilege principle:
Minimise host OS footprint:

1.Limit Node Access: We should limit exposure of the control plane and nodes to internet. If K*S running on cloud, it is likely that in some cases you won't be able to access the control plane anyway.
->For Self hosted clusters or in some managed k8s providers, provising nodes in private network is one way to achieve this. 
->And also with public access disabled and access using VPN. 
-> Security groups by allowing specific IPs to access
2.SSH HARDENING and sudo
3.Restrict User privileges from privilege escalation by editing sudoers anf sshd_config file
4.Remove obsolete packages and services
      systemctl list-units --type service
5.Restrict kernel modules:
      Modules can manually loaded into kernel using modprobe or insmod
            lsmod -> list all modules
